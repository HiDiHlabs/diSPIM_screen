# diSPIM_screen
Tools to analyse diSPIM imaging data and evaluate mitotic phenotypes

This repository contains scripts used for the analysis of mitotic phenotypes in 3D spheroids based on diSPIM imaging data. The corresponding manuscript is available as a pre-print:

* [Automated screening by 3D light-sheet microscopy with high spatial and temporal resolution reveals mitotic phenotypes]

This repository contains:

* hSPIM image processing pipeline manual (with installation instructions)
* CNN analysis (in Python) for detecting mitotic phases
* KNIME workflows and R script for evaluating mitotic phenotypes

To install the hSPIM image processing pipeline, please download the .zip file and tutorial [here]. This software was developed in collaboration with Markus Fangerau and Ingmar Gergel at mBits imaging GmbH and is free for academic use.
